          Thoughts on why I built this site with React and Next.js vs another
          stack or plain ole HTML/CSS.
        </h2>
        <p>
          I&apos;m used to React from my day job so writing in another framework
          didn&apos;t really make sense to me. I could have spent some time to
          actually learn Vue.js or Svelte but that would have taken time away
          from{" "}
          <i>
            <u>actually doing the thing</u>
          </i>
          .

        <h2>Getting stuff done vs Just thinking about doing it.</h2>

          TL;DR Better to have something rather than nothing. Even if what
          you&apos;ve made is crappy you still made it.

          This is something I&apos;ve historically struggled with. I came to the
          conclusion that I needed to at least write stuff down in my senior
          year of college. It&apos;s helped, but I still haven&apos;t really
          produced much of what I wanted to produce. Part of that is because of
          perfectionist tendencies that I need to learn how to relax in specific
          contexts (I should still keep them when writing critical code though).
          Part of it is <u>organization</u>. I&apos;ve been putting things down
          in too many places. Physical journals, Notion, text files, git repos,
          two different note apps. I&apos;m still working on this part but I
          think that trying to do more on my laptop, using folders, and aiming
          for the simplest file types will help.

          I went to paper as a reaction to using technology too much. I&apos;ve
          found a better balance since that point and I believe that replacing
          smartphone use with laptop use will suffice. Smartphones, particularly
          iOS devices, are too limiting when it comes to creation. As a result,
          I personally tend to fall back into consumption.
